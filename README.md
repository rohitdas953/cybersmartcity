# CyberShield â€“ AI-Powered Smart City Cybersecurity Platform

CyberShield is an interactive system that simulates real-time cyberattack detection and response for smart cities. It monitors IoT devices, traffic lights, CCTV cameras, power grids, and other smart city infrastructure to detect and respond to cyber threats.

## Features

### 1. AI Threat Detection Engine
- Detects cyber anomalies in smart city devices
- Processes simulated IoT traffic data
- Uses anomaly detection machine learning algorithms
- Classifies threats as "Safe", "Suspicious", or "Attack" with confidence levels

### 2. Smart City Infrastructure Map
- Real-time dashboard showing smart city components
- Visual indicators for device status (green for safe, red for under attack)
- Interactive elements to view device details and logs

### 3. Incident Response Simulation
- Automated countermeasures for detected attacks
- Immutable logging of security events
- Response recommendation system

### 4. Threat Intelligence Dashboard
- Statistics panel showing attack metrics and system uptime
- Visual graphs of daily threats and attack types

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, Recharts
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express
- **ML Engine**: Simulated anomaly detection
- **Database**: Simulated data storage for device logs and attack reports

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm run install-all`
3. Start the application: `npm start`

This will launch both the frontend and backend servers.
